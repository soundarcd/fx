Environment Segregation:

There is no clear indication that production and non-production environments are segregated into separate networks.
It is recommended to establish dedicated VNets for production and non-production environments to enhance security and isolation.
Infrastructure Monitoring:

The infrastructure should be monitored using Azure-native monitoring tools or a solution recommended by ARB (Architecture Review Board) for better visibility and compliance.
Traffic Management & Security:

It is recommended to integrate Azure Load Balancer, Azure Front Door, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) to improve traffic distribution, security, and global reachability.



Load Balancing:

Each application endpoint is managed by a dedicated F5 load balancer instance, ensuring efficient traffic distribution and high availability.
CI/CD Infrastructure:

The Jenkins servers are hosted on an on-premises managed Kubernetes cluster, providing containerized CI/CD execution with centralized management.
