A separate Jenkins setup for the production environment is crucial to ensure proper isolation and security.
When migrating CI/CD to GitHub Actions Workflow, it is essential to use self-hosted runners with a dedicated pool for production jobs to maintain strict separation.
CI jobs should incorporate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
Runtime vulnerability scanning must be implemented to detect zero-day vulnerabilities and enhance overall security posture.
