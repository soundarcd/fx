Containerization & Deployment:
All three CM applications should be containerized and deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for improved scalability and management.
Horizontal scalability can be fully leveraged if shared session management is implemented, eliminating the need for sticky sessions.
API Modernization:
API gateways should be introduced to manage and secure API traffic after a clear separation of backend and frontend services.
Database Modernization:
The self-managed Microsoft SQL Server should be migrated to a managed SQL Server instance, ensuring better availability, automated maintenance, and security compliance.
Regular backups should align with Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) to prevent data loss.
Oracle Database Migration:
The on-prem Oracle database should be migrated to a self-managed Oracle instance in the cloud.
Active-passive replication should be implemented to maintain high availability, eliminating the need to connect from the cloud to an on-premises database.
