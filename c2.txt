Data Management Gaps:

There are no defined data backup policies, posing a risk to data availability and recovery.
There are no data retention policies in place, leading to uncontrolled data accumulation.
Data Growth & Volume:

The data size is in terabytes (TB), with records dating back 30 years.
The data is expected to grow at a rate of 30% year over year (YoY), increasing storage demands and potential performance risks.

Establish Data Backup Policies:

Define data backup policies aligned with business continuity planning (BCP) to ensure data availability, recovery, and resilience against failures.
Implement Data Retention Policies:

Define data retention policies to purge or archive old data, reducing storage growth and improving system performance.
Proper data retention will also help minimize legal liabilities associated with PII, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
