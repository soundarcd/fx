Infrastructure Utilization:

Grafana metrics indicate that the provisioned infrastructure is underutilized, suggesting opportunities for optimization and cost reduction.
Server Decommissioning:

Some servers have been identified for decommissioning, which can further streamline resource usage and reduce operational overhead.
Database Support Lifecycle:

Microsoft SQL Server 2019 has reached the end of mainstream support and has entered the extended support phase.
This transition may lead to additional support costs or necessitate an upgrade to a supported version to ensure continued security and compliance.




Application Modernization:

Rearchitect applications into multiple containerized services, separating backend and frontend components.
This approach enables better scalability, orchestration, and resource efficiency.
Database Migration:

Migrate Microsoft SQL Server to the cloud, leveraging managed services for automated backups, maintenance, and high availability, reducing manual configuration and operational overhead.
Adoption of Azure Native Services:

Transition to Azure-native solutions such as Azure Load Balancer, API Gateway, Front Door, WAF, Monitoring, and Logging.
This enhances performance, security, and observability, while reducing reliance on manually managed infrastructure.
