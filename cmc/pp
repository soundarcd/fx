Current State of GRID Network PoC in CMC

Completed:
CMC's non-production subscription has been successfully onboarded to the GRID network.
GRID network components (VNet with Consul, HAProxy) have been deployed within the subscription.
Initial validation of cloud-to-on-prem connectivity was performed but was unsuccessful.
Thomas engaged Benjamin J. Patterson, who provided support for the GRID setup.
The PoC VNet is now synchronized with the GRID network.
On-prem Facets has been added to CI Central, a prerequisite for accessing Facets via GRID.
Next Steps:
Complete PoC validation on Monday (allowing time for Consul and CI Central synchronization).
Request CIDR blocks for non-production VNets.
Register the allocated CIDRs in GRID after VNet creation.
Validate both cloud-to-on-prem and on-prem-to-cloud connectivity.
