Goal:
The goal of the PoC is to complete the configuration of the GRID Network, onboard onperm, and cloud resources that should be accessed across, and validate the access.

Completed:
CMC's non-production subscription has been successfully onboarded to the GRID network.
GRID network components (VNet with Consul, HAProxy) have been deployed within the subscription.
Initial validation of cloud-to-on-prem connectivity was performed but was unsuccessful.
Thomas engaged Benjamin J. Patterson, who provided support for the GRID setup.
The PoC VNet is now synchronized with the GRID network.
On-prem Facets has been added to CI Central, a prerequisite for accessing Facets via GRID.
Next Steps:
Complete PoC validation on Monday (allowing time for Consul and CI Central synchronization). [CMC Migration Team]
Request CIDR blocks for non-production VNets from ETIPS.  [CMC Migration Team]
Register the allocated CIDRs in GRID after VNet creation using Terraform. [CMC Migration Team]
Validate both cloud-to-on-prem and on-prem-to-cloud connectivity. [CMC Migration Team]

Create a Personal User Token 

From: Montplaisir, Dennis J 

In the new teams, the team tokens are managed in vault.uhg.com and are intentionally lived.  

  

You'll have to user a personal token for now. There is some back and forth with the EPL team if they want PRM enabled automation for retrieving that team token (like is done for service principles) or will authenticate directly to vault with OIDC. 

  

Iverson, Matthew D FYI 

We will need to replace that token at a later date by a Team Token 

Create Secret to store TFEToken (using personal one, will need to be replace with Team Token)
